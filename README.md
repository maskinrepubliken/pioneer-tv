# Pioneer TV

Maskinrepubliken's Raspberry Pi TV box for a 32" TV: Cineasterna, SVT Play and Jellyfin as
web pages in a kiosk Chromium on Weston, driven by a Bluetooth gamepad, with
HDMI-CEC for the TV's volume and power.

The box does not play video itself. Chromium does, with Raspberry Pi's Widevine
build for Cineasterna. Pioneer TV is everything around that:

| Part | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| `extension/` | Chromium extension: the launcher page, d-pad spatial navigation on any site, an on-screen keyboard for search, a quick menu and toasts. |
| `daemon/` | Python daemon: gamepad → virtual keyboard and mouse (uinput), HDMI-CEC volume and power, TV remote passthrough, system status, a settings page with JSON API, WebSocket bridge to the extension. |
| `system/` | Weston kiosk config, Chromium start script, systemd units, udev rule and the install script. |

## Design

Paper, ink and serif. The whole system is defined in
`extension/content/paper.css`: cream paper, warm ink, a mustard accent, cards
with a thin warm line, rounded corners and a soft lift, small caps for labels.
Type is EB Garamond throughout, bundled under the SIL Open Font License in
`extension/fonts/`. Icons are simple line icons in `extension/content/icons.js`,
and the service illustrations are ink line art with a soft tint in
`extension/launcher/art.js`, keyed by service id (a service with a `logo` URL
shows that instead). The front page has a hearth: warm light breathing at the
bottom, a few embers drifting up, tiles that rise in once, illustrations that
float. Only transform and opacity animate, so the compositor carries it, and it
all stops under prefers-reduced-motion.

## Designing the launcher (no Pi needed)

Everything in `extension/` runs as plain files, so open

```
extension/launcher/index.html?tv=1
```

in Chrome. Arrow keys navigate, Enter selects, Escape goes back. `?tv=1` turns
on TV mode so Enter on the search field opens the on-screen keyboard. Edit
`launcher.css` (tokens at the top), `launcher.js` and `default-services.js`;
reload. The page is laid out on a 1280x720 canvas in `vw` units, so a laptop
window looks like the TV. Drop logos in `extension/launcher/logos/` and set
`logo` on a service to use them instead of the letter glyph.

To try the extension parts on real sites, load `extension/` as an unpacked
extension at `chrome://extensions` (developer mode). Then any page gets the
spatial navigation and the overlays, and these shortcuts work:

| Shortcut | Action |
| --- | --- |
| Alt+Shift+H | Launcher (home) |
| Alt+Shift+K | Toggle on-screen keyboard |
| Alt+Shift+M | Toggle quick menu |

The launcher is at `chrome-extension://dpigdefepjjejbkidlabpjlnleidgjaf/launcher/index.html`
(the ID is fixed by the key in the manifest).

## Settings and status

The daemon serves a settings page at `http://127.0.0.1:8765/`. On the TV it is
reached from the quick menu (Start → Inställningar), where the spatial
navigation and on-screen keyboard work like on any other page; a USB keyboard
works too, and while one is plugged in the on-screen keyboard stays out of the
way. The quick menu itself shows Wi-Fi, Tailscale (and whether the Jellyfin peer is
online), connected gamepads with battery, and temperature.

The page has: status (network, Tailscale, CEC, gamepads, thermals and power
throttling), Wi-Fi networks with connect and forget plus saving a network that
is not in range yet, Bluetooth scan and pairing
for any number of gamepads, the services shown on the launcher, controller
tuning, TV behaviour, and system actions (restart Chromium, reboot, update from
git, logs). Changes are saved to `/etc/pioneer-tv/settings.json` and applied
without a restart; `config.toml` remains the place for the full button map.

To design the settings page without a Pi, open
`daemon/pioneertv/web/settings.html?mock=1` in a browser. It is responsive, so the
same page works on a phone.

**Remote access.** Keep the daemon on localhost and publish it to your tailnet:

```
sudo tailscale serve --bg 8765
```

Then the page is at `https://<pi-name>.<tailnet>.ts.net/` from any of your
devices, with Tailscale doing the authentication. If you instead bind the daemon
to `0.0.0.0` in `config.toml`, set an access key under Fjärråtkomst; non-local
requests must then carry it (`?token=` once, stored as a cookie).

## Logs and CEC debugging

Start → Meny → **Loggar** opens a log sheet over whatever is on screen. Left
and right switch between the daemon, the display, the updater, Bluetooth,
NetworkManager, Tailscale and the CEC trace; up and down scroll; A refreshes.
The daemon and CEC tabs follow live. The CEC trace shows every command the
daemon sends (`>>`) and everything it hears on the bus (`<<`), so a TV remote
press that does nothing can be traced to either "never arrived" or "arrived
but is not mapped".

The TV page in settings has the same trace, the bus topology from `cec-ctl -S`
(the Pi should appear as a Playback Device and the TV as logical address 0),
test buttons, and a box for raw `cec-ctl` arguments.

## Updating the box

Start → Meny → **Uppdatera systemet** checks GitHub and, only if there is
something new, pulls it, reinstalls and restarts the daemon and Chromium. The
screen goes blank for a few seconds. If nothing is new it just says so. The
System page in settings shows the installed commit, lists the incoming commits,
has an install button with a live log, and a "reinstall anyway" for when the
Pi is up to date but broken. The update runs as its own systemd unit
(`pioneer-tv-update`), so it survives restarting the daemon that started it;
its log is under Loggar. The installer records the clone path in
`/etc/pioneer-tv/repo`, so keep the clone you installed from, and keep it on the
branch you want to follow.

## Gamepad mapping

| Button | Action |
| --- | --- |
| D-pad, left stick | Move focus (arrow keys) |
| A / Cross | Select (Enter) |
| B / Circle | Back (Escape) |
| X / Square | Play, pause (Space) |
| Y / Triangle | On-screen keyboard |
| L1, R1 | Shift+Tab, Tab (previous, next focusable) |
| L2, R2 | TV volume down, up (CEC, repeats while held) |
| Right stick | Mouse pointer; click on the stick to left-click |
| Start | Quick menu |
| Select | Status toast; hold to toggle TV power |
| Guide / PS / Xbox | Home. Also wakes the TV and switches input when the pad connects |

All of it is in `/etc/pioneer-tv/config.toml` (see `daemon/config.example.toml`).
The TV remote works too: keys the TV forwards over CEC are mapped in `[cec.remote]`.

## Installing on the Pi

Raspberry Pi OS Lite, 64-bit, Bookworm, user `pi`, wired Ethernet.

```
git clone -b main https://github.com/maskinrepubliken/pioneer-tv.git
cd pioneer-tv
sudo system/install.sh
sudo reboot
```

The box follows the branch it was installed from; `main` is the one to use.

The installer pulls in Weston, Chromium, Widevine, v4l-utils, BlueZ, aiohttp and
evdev, copies the repo to `/opt/pioneer-tv`, installs the systemd units,
sets the video mode for the board (1080p on a Pi 4/5, 720p on a Pi 3), enables
zram and sets the CPU governor to performance at
boot, and sets the boot target to graphical. Rerunning it is safe. Pair the first gamepad from the shell (later ones from the settings page):

```
bluetoothctl
  scan on
  pair <MAC>
  trust <MAC>
  connect <MAC>
```

A pad that was paired but does not reconnect on its own was not trusted:
`bluetoothctl trust <MAC>`. Pairing from the settings page does this for you.
If the onboard radio is dead and you use a USB adapter, put
`dtoverlay=disable-bt` in config.txt: with two adapters, one of them silent,
pads connect and drop within a second.
A Switch Pro Controller reconnects when you press its Home button; it does
not wake on any button like a PlayStation pad.

If `bluetoothctl` says "No default controller available", the kernel did not
bring up the onboard chip. On Bookworm the kernel attaches it itself (the old
`hciuart` service is not used and fails by design). Check `dmesg | grep -i bcm`:
no output means the chip did not enumerate, which a real power cycle usually
fixes after an unclean shutdown; a firmware error means
`sudo apt install --reinstall bluez-firmware firmware-brcm80211`. Make sure
`dtoverlay=disable-bt` is not in config.txt, and `rfkill unblock bluetooth`.

Tailscale is optional: `curl -fsSL https://tailscale.com/install.sh | sh && sudo tailscale up`.

Log in to Cineasterna and Jellyfin once with the on-screen keyboard; the Chromium
profile in `~/.pioneer-tv/chromium` remembers the sessions.

### Useful commands

```
journalctl -fu pioneer-tv-daemon        # gamepad, CEC and bridge log
journalctl -fu pioneer-tv-weston        # Weston output
tail -f ~/.pioneer-tv/chromium.log      # Chromium output (extension load errors land here)
sudo python3 -m pioneertv -v            # run the daemon in the foreground (from /opt/pioneer-tv/daemon)
curl -s localhost:8765/api/status     # what the settings page sees
cec-ctl -d /dev/cec0 --to 0 --standby # TV off, straight from the shell
vcgencmd get_throttled                # 0x0 means the TV's USB port is enough
```

## How it fits together

```
 gamepad ──evdev──▶ daemon ──uinput──▶ Weston ──▶ Chromium (kiosk, --load-extension)
                      │                              ├─ content scripts: spatial nav, keyboard, HUD
                      │◀────── ws://127.0.0.1:8765/ws ┤  background: single tab, home, dev shortcuts
                      │──── http://127.0.0.1:8765/ ───▶│  launcher page: services from config
                      └──cec-ctl──▶ /dev/cec0 ──▶ TV     settings page: status, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, services
```

Navigation keys go through a virtual keyboard so every page, and Chromium
itself, sees ordinary key presses. Buttons that mean something to the shell
(home, menu, keyboard) go over the WebSocket as events. CEC is only ever
touched by the daemon.

## Boards

The installer reads the model from the device tree and writes
`/etc/pioneer-tv/board.env`. A Pi 4 or 5 runs at 1920x1080 with Chromium
compositing and rasterising on the GPU; a Pi 3 runs at 1280x720 with
`--disable-gpu`, because its VideoCore IV cannot give Chromium the GLES 3 context
it wants. To cap a Pi 4 at 720p, run the installer once as
`PIONEER_TV_MODE=1280x720@60 sudo system/install.sh`; the choice is written to
`/etc/pioneer-tv/mode` and kept by later updates (delete the file to go back to
the board default). GPU flags can be overridden with `PIONEER_TV_GPU_FLAGS` in
`chromium.env`. A Pi 3 was too slow for
Cineasterna's software-decoded Widevine video; a Pi 4 with 4 GB is comfortable.

## Known board quirk: no hardware cursor

Weston 14 on the Pi 3's VideoCore IV aborts (an assertion in
backend-drm/state-propose.c) the first time any client shows a mouse cursor,
and none of Weston's switches avoid it. So the box has no pointer device at
all: the daemon streams right-stick motion to the extension, which draws its
own pointer (`cursor.js`), delivers hover and clicks to what is under it, and
scrolls when pushed against the top or bottom edge. A clicks at the pointer
for a few seconds after it last moved, and is the normal "select" otherwise.
`cursor.css` also hides any system cursor in case a real mouse is plugged in;
that would still crash Weston on this board, so do not.

## Performance notes

- Players cap stream quality to the window size, so the video mode is also the
  quality ceiling: 1080p on a Pi 4, 720p on a Pi 3. Widevine content
  (Cineasterna) is always software decoded.
- Chromium's disk cache lives in RAM (`/dev/shm`). Never let the SD card sit
  in the playback path.
- Jellyfin is reached over Tailscale at the address in the service config. Set
  its web client's playback quality so the server transcodes to H.264 rather
  than sending HEVC, which the Pi's browser cannot decode in hardware.
- Check `chrome://gpu` for "Video Decode: Hardware accelerated". If it is not,
  unprotected H.264 (SVT Play, Jellyfin) is software decoded too.
- Weston has `watch=true` on the autolaunch: if Chromium dies, Weston exits and
  systemd restarts both, which is faster and cleaner than a hung browser.

## Verify these against the live sites

- Jellyfin Web's search route is `/web/#/search.html?query=` on 10.9 and 10.10.
- SVT Play's is `/sok?q=`.
